			<h3><p>Adventures in STEM</p></h3>
			<h3><p>AJ's Post February 25, 2017</p></h3>
			<h4><p>	Before coming to Hill, I was interested in STEM, but didn’t really have any means of pursuing my interest so when I came to Hill and had the 		opportunity to take more STEM-based classes, I was really excited. Prior to the start of the year, I was already interested in computer 				programming, and now that I can take multiple classes on the subject, I am even more excited about it!
					When I came into my freshman year, I had absolutely no idea how to program, so I enrolled in the intro class. So far this year, we’ve been working with Python and Python on the Raspberry Pi. For me, Python was a good language to begin with, because it had a lot of available shortcuts and can actually assist you with writing code. We’ve covered a wide range of things this year, slowly building up our “toolbox” so we can make more and more advanced programs. I’ve enjoyed the subject matter a lot but it’s been hard for me to interact with my classmates, since there are only three girls in the class, including me. I was already considering computer programming for my future and was definitely encouraged by taking this class and even more by attending Femmehacks and seeing that I definitely could have a future in this field. (and also be really cool too!)
					As for math, I’m really not that good to be honest, but have still found success (somehow) in my Math 11 class. We’ve been reviewing things that I had gone over before and have now solidified and been able to use in other contexts since the program is integrated. My level will progress from Algebra 1 this year to Pre-Calc my senior year, using knowledge from previous years so we can still retain the information and use it in more that one way each.
					Our Integrated Science program is intended to go through Bio, Chem, and Physics in two years so we have the opportunity to take more advanced classes junior and senior year. Right now, we are studying Physics and I’m surprisingly not dead. (yet) At the level we’re learning it at right now, I think it’s not as impossible as I thought it would be and that, as long as one has a basic understanding of algebra, they would be pretty okay with the actual math that goes into Physics.
					All in all, I really think that I have some really good opportunities where I am and will be able to learn a lot and be successful. I’m hoping that by the time college rolls around, I’ll be a lot more advanced and know more what I’m doing. Honestly STEM is actually wonderful and I really hope that more girls will join the field and be as hyped about it as I am.
