Students will have the option to join the Apple Developer Program for a $100 annual fee if they wish to attempt to have a project available for download through iTunes.</h3>
			<h2>Engineering</h2>
				<h3>Engineering I Students develop an engineer’s perspective of effective problem solving and engineering design. Students will explore fundamental mechanical engineering concepts such as statics (objects in equilibrium) and dynamics (objects in acceleration). There will be substantial group project work but very little if any assigned homework. For 2016 – 2017, this course may be taken as a seventh graded course and will receive art credit.</h3>
				<h3>Engineering 2 - Prerequisite: Engineering 1. Students continue to expand their engineer’s perspective of effective problem solving and engineering design while gaining new skills with the introduction of 3D CAD software, fabrication with rapid prototyping, and preliminary development of an advanced project that will carry over into Engineering 3. Our current focus is design and development of search and rescue robots. Robots provide a good tool for learning how to think in terms of systems integration. Adapting robots to the requirements of search and rescue lead students through significant mechanical challenges that expand their knowledge of static and dynamic behaviors (as well as control system challenges explored in Engineering 3).
