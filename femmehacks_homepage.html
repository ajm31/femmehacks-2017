		<h2>Integrated Science</h2>
		<h3>Integrated Science 1 (Honors) – Requires application and department approval Integrated Science Honors aims to cover the content and skills in basic Biology, Chemistry, and Physics necessary that the student will be prepared to be successful in taking the Advanced Placement Course in one of the aforementioned disciplines in their 5th Form Year. Using the Modelling Method, this course will cover selected topics in class along with a highly correlated lab experience. Topics covered in this first year include, but are not limited to; the concept of Mass, Biological Classification, Velocity, the Atom, Temperature and Heat, the concept of Evolution, Acceleration and Forces, and finally a highly integrated unit on Energy as it pertains to all three disciplines. This course aims to take only the most highly motivated students through a fast-paced, student-driven learning experience in the sciences.</h3>
		<h3>Integrated Science 2 (Honors) – Requires Integrated Science 1 (Honors) and/or Department Approval by application. This course acts as a continuation of the curriculum covered in Integrated Science Honors 1. This course further explores content and skills, also using a Modelling curriculum, to investigate a deeper understanding of the content and to complete the Integrated Curriculum. Topics covered include, but are not limited to; Newton’s Second Law, Electrostatics, the Modern Atomic Theory, Nomenclature and Stoichiometry, Bonding, the Cell and its Reproduction, basic Genetics, and 2D Motion. Upon completion of this course, the student may choose an appropriate AP course in Science for their 5th Form year with the help of their IS2 instructor.</h3>

		<h3>Integrated Mathematics 11 – Rates of Change: From Data to Abstraction This is the first course in a four-year sequence of integrated mathematics courses. The course emphasizes the mathematical process of building from concrete examples to generalized statements about mathematical objects. While the course covers a combination of topics covered in traditional high school Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2 courses, it does so in a way that highlights connections among the different branches of mathematics. Topics include univariate and bivariate data; algebraic and geometric representations of lines, including parallel and perpendicular lines; intersections of lines, including angles, systems of equations, and systems of inequalities; exponentials and logarithms; sequences; and the applications of these topics to finance. Students who successfully complete this course will be prepared to take Integrated Mathematics 22 the following year or Integrated Mathematics 32 (Honors) with departmental approval.</h3>
		<h3>Integrated Mathematics 21 – Rates of Change: From Data to Abstraction (Honors) - Requires departmental approval. Prerequisite: Algebra 1. This is the first course in a three-year sequence of integrated mathematics courses. The course emphasizes the mathematical process of building from concrete examples to generalized statements about mathematical objects. While the course covers a combination of topics covered in traditional high school Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2 courses, it does so in a way that highlights connections among the different branches of mathematics. Topics include univariate and bivariate data; algebraic and geometric representations of lines, including parallel and perpendicular lines; intersections of lines, including angles, systems of equations, and systems of inequalities; exponentials and logarithms; sequences; and the applications of these topics to finance. While this course covers the same topics as the Integrated Mathematics 1 course, it does so to a greater depth and with a heavier emphasis on conceptual understanding. Students who successfully complete this course will be prepared to take Integrated Mathematics 32 (Honors) the following year.</h3>
		<h3>Integrated Mathematics 31 – Analysis in One, Two, and Three Dimensions (Honors) - Requires departmental approval. Prerequisite: Superior performance in Algebra 1; a course in Geometry is preferred. This is the first course in an accelerated two-year sequence of integrated mathematics courses. The course emphasizes the mathematical process of building from concrete examples to generalized statements about mathematical objects. While the course covers a combination of topics covered in traditional high school Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2 courses, it does so in a way that highlights connections among the different branches of mathematics. In addition to the topics covered in the Integrated Mathematics 21 (Honors) course, this course will explore algebraic and geometric interpretations of area and volume, and it will introduce coding as a tool of exploration and problem solving. Students who successfully complete this course will be prepared to take Integrated Mathematics 42 (Honors) the following year</h3>
		<h3>Integrated Mathematics 41 – Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry (Honors) - Requires departmental approval. Prerequisite: Superior performance in Algebra 1 and Geometry. This is a rigorous, integrated mathematics course, which condenses two years of traditional high school mathematics into a single year. It is a necessarily fast-paced course that explores topics including: manipulation of algebraic expressions; solution of equations and inequalities, and of systems; transformation, composition, and analysis of functions and their inverses; the behaviors of algebraic and transcendental functions; analytic trigonometry; trigonometry of right and oblique triangles; analytic geometry; sequences and series; and introductory probability and statistics. Students are required to have a graphing calculator. Students who successfully complete this course may proceed directly to AB Calculus (AP).</h3>
